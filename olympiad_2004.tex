\begin{enumerate}

\item Let $ABC$ be an acute-angled triangle with $AB$ not equal to $AC$.  
The circle with diameter $BC$ intersects the sides $AB$ and $AC$ at $M$ and $N$ respectively.  
Denote by $O$ the midpoint of the side $BC$.  
The bisectors of the angles $\angle BAC$ and $\angle MON$ intersect at $R$.  
Prove that the circumcircles of the triangles $BMR$ and $CNR$ have a common point lying on the side $BC$.

\item Find all polynomials $f$ with real coefficients such that for all real numbers $a, b, c$ with  
$a + b + c = 0$ we have  
$f(a - b) + f(b - c) + f(c - a) = 2f(a + b + c)$.

\item Define a ``hook'' to be a figure made up of six unit squares as shown in the picture below,  
or any of the figures obtained by applying rotations and reflections to this figure.

Determine all $m$ by $n$ rectangles that can be covered without gaps and without overlaps with hooks such that

The rectangle is covered without gaps and without overlaps.  
No part of a hook covers area outside the rectangle.

\item Let $n$ be an integer greater than or equal to $3$.  
Let $t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4, t_5$ be positive real numbers such that  

$n^2 + 1$ is greater than  
$\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} t_i\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{t_i}\right)$.  

Show that $t_i, t_j, t_k$ are side lengths of a triangle for all indices $i, j, k$ satisfying  
$i$ less than $j$ and $j$ less than $k$, and each index at most $n$.

\item In a convex quadrilateral $ABCD$ the diagonal $BD$ does not bisect the angles $ABC$ and $CDA$.  
The point $P$ inside $ABCD$ satisfies  
$\angle PBC = \angle DBA$ and $\angle PDC = \angle BDA$.  

Prove that $ABCD$ is a cyclic quadrilateral if and only if $AP = CP$.

\item We call a positive integer alternating if every two consecutive digits in its decimal representation are of different parity.  
Find all positive integers $n$ such that $n$ has a multiple which is alternating.
