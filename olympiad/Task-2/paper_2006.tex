\begin{enumerate}

\item Let $ABC$ be a triangle with incentre $I$.  
A point $P$ in the interior of the triangle satisfies  
$\angle PBA + \angle PCA = \angle PBC + \angle PCB$.  

Show that $AP >= AI$, and that equality holds if and only if $P = I$.

\item Let $P$ be a regular $2006$-gon.  
A diagonal of $P$ is called good if its endpoints divide the boundary of $P$ into two parts, each composed of an odd number of sides of $P$.  
The sides of $P$ are also called good.  

Suppose $P$ has been dissected into triangles by $2003$ diagonals, no two of which have a common point in the interior of $P$.  
Find the maximum number of isosceles triangles having two good sides that could appear in such a configuration.

\item Determine the least real number $M$ such that the inequality  
$|ab(a^2 - b^2) + bc(b^2 - c^2) + ca(c^2 - a^2)| <= M(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^2$  
holds for all real numbers $a$, $b$ and $c$.

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}

\item Determine all pairs $(x, y)$ of integers such that  
$1 + 2^x + 2^{2x+1} = y^2$.

\item Let $P(x)$ be a polynomial of degree $n > 1$ with integer coefficients and let $k$ be a positive integer.  
Consider the polynomial $Q(x) = P(P(P(x)))$, where $P$ occurs $k$ times.  
Prove that there are at most $n$ integers $t$ such that $Q(t) = t$.

\item Assign to each side $b$ of a convex polygon $P$ the maximum area of a triangle that has $b$ as a side and is contained in $P$.  
Show that the sum of the areas assigned to the sides of $P$ is at least twice the area of $P$.
