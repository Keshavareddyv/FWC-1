# 7 Segment Display

## Introduction
A 7 segment display is an electronic display device used to show decimal numerals.
It consists of seven LEDs named a to g. By turning ON specific segments,
different digits can be formed.

## Aim
To interface a 7 segment display and verify the formation of digits.

## Components Required
- 7 segment display  
- Current limiting resistors  
- Breadboard  
- Power supply  
- Connecting wires  

## Files Included
- procedure.pdf : Contains detailed step-by-step procedure followed in the experiment.

## Procedure Summary
The display was placed on the breadboard and the common pin was identified.
Each segment was connected through a resistor to avoid excess current.
Different input combinations were applied and the glowing segments were observed.

## Result
The required digits were displayed successfully on the 7 segment display.

## Learning Outcome
Understood the working principle of a 7 segment display and how
input combinations control individual segments.
