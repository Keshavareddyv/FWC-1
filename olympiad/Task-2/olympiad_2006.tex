\textbf{Problem 1.}

Let $ABC$ be a triangle with incentre $I$.
A point $P$ inside the triangle satisfies
$PBA + PCA = PBC + PCB$.
Show that $AP >= AI$,
and that equality holds if and only if $P = I$.

\textbf{Problem 2.}

Let $P$ be a regular polygon with $2006$ sides.
A diagonal of $P$ is called good if its endpoints divide the boundary of $P$
into two parts, each consisting of an odd number of sides.
The sides of $P$ are also called good.

Suppose that $P$ is dissected into triangles by $2003$ diagonals,
no two of which have a common interior point.
Find the maximum number of isosceles triangles
having two good sides that can occur in such a dissection.

\textbf{Problem 3.}

Determine the least real number $M$ such that the inequality
$$
|ab(a^2 - b^2) + bc(b^2 - c^2) + ca(c^2 - a^2)|
<= M (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^2
$$
holds for all real numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$.

\textbf{Problem 4.}

Determine all pairs $(x,y)$ of integers such that
$$
1 + 2^x + 2^{2x+1} = y^2.
$$

\textbf{Problem 5.}

Let $P(x)$ be a polynomial of degree $n > 1$ with integer coefficients,
and let $k$ be a positive integer.
Define
$Q(x) = P(P(P(x)))$ where $P$ occurs $k$ times.
Prove that there are at most $n$ integers $t$ such that $Q(t) = t$.

\textbf{Problem 6.}

For each side $b$ of a convex polygon $P$,
assign the maximum area of a triangle
that has $b$ as a side and is contained in $P$.
Show that the sum of the assigned areas
is at least twice the area of $P$.
